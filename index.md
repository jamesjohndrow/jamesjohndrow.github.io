I am currently a Stein fellow in the Statistics Department at Stanford. You can see a current list of my papers here or on my [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0001-7919-364X.html) page. My research interests lie at the interface of statistics and applied probability. A few main themes are:

1. Scalable Bayesian computation
2. Computational complexity of MCMC
3. Mixture models, particularly for contingency tables and categorical data
4. Point processes, with applications in multivariate extreme value theory and phylodynamics
5. Applied projects in algorithmic fairness, population estimation, and A/B testing

For specific papers, see my arXiv author page.

I am a Ph.D. alum of the Department of Statistical Science at Duke and an alum of Amherst College. 
My CV is available for download here [WARNING: this is not at all up to date]. 
I am a statistical consultant for HRDAG and have been a data science advisor/consultant for DataPad, eBay, and Treasure Data. 
I have also collaborated with MaxPoint Interactive.

Prior to graduate school, I worked in research laboratories at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 
where I studied a variety of problems in cell biology and signal transduction using Drosophila Melanogaster as a model organism. 
I was later a member of the Cox lab at UCSF, where I studied Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis. 
Subsequently, I was a consultant at NERA Economic Consulting.

I spent most of 2011 living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and traveling in South America and Europe.

In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, cycling and running (see my strava), traveling, and spending time with my wife and two poodles, 
not necessarily in that order.
